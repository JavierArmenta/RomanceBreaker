# Romance Breaker
##### "Is your girlfriend/boyfriend complaining that you wake up too late every morning or that you are not romantic enough but of course you're too lazy to change? I have a solution for you."  
  
Introducing *Romance Breaker*, a small python script which sends a custom morning message from a list to your significant other every morning at a given time range on Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, now doesn't this sound great already?

### Most loved features:
  - You can still be lazy
  - You can still wake up late
  - Relationship improvement (I don't take any responsibility if Romance BreakerÂ® doesn't improve relationship status)
  - Magic

# Custom messages setup
###### Android Users
Android users may want to edit the file with their preferred text editing app as the file will be in the Downloads folder of their devices  
  
I guess you also want to send custom messages, so here we go: 
On line 10 *(14 for WhatsApp)* replace the messages in between ```" "``` with your own custom messages, you can also add more than three by adding after the ```"``` of the last message a comma and a new message, always in between ```" "```s. 
If we want to add ```NewCustomMessage``` to the list below. 
```python
customMsgs = ["Good morning beautiful", "I'm too lazy", "To write messages on my own"]
```
We just need to edit it like this:
```python
customMsgs = ["Good morning beautiful", "I'm too lazy", "To write messages on my own", "NewCustomMessage"]
```
# Custom time range setup
To change the time range at which the #MorningText should be sent just change line 12 *(16 for WhatsApp)* with your custom range:
```python
customTimeInterval = ["04:20", "16:20"]
```
Make sure hour is always two digits
